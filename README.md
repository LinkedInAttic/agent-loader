Agent Loader
============

#### Project Forked

This is a fork of EA's [Agent Loader](https://github.com/electronicarts/ea-agent-loader) which is
deprecated and no longer accepts contributions.

We've made minor changes to it for our needs; this is not a general purpose fork.

#### Project Deprecated

With the introduction of JDK9, dynamically self attaching Java Agents is considered bad practice. As such we are deprecating this project and will no longer continue to maintain it.
The project remains here for reference and for JDK8 users.

Brief
============
EA Agent Loader is a collection of utilities for [java agent](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html) developers.
It allows programmers to write and test their java agents using dynamic agent loading (without using the -javaagent jvm parameter).
